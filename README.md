# FuzzBALL Ghidra Script

This project, conducted under the supervision of Professor McCamant at the
University of Minnesota, is on a mission to elevate the accessibility of
FuzzBALL, a powerful symbolic execution tool for binary code available on
GitHub at
[https://github.com/bitblaze-fuzzball/fuzzball](https://github.com/bitblaze-fuzzball/fuzzball).
In focusing on two pivotal aspects, we aim to make FuzzBALL more user-friendly
and relevant to a broader audience.
